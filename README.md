# FPGA Stopwatch

Stopwatch circuit on FPGA, written in Verilog, that counts minutes and seconds up to an hour; using buttons and switches on the FPGA, we are able to pause the stopwatch, and adjust either the minutes or seconds.

```
1. Basic clock which counts minutes and seconds (e.g. 1 minute 43 seconds â‡’ 0143)
2. Adjust mode (switch activated) which enables users to increment either the minutes or seconds
3. Pause mode, in which the counter does not change, but the display blinks.
